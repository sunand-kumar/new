Loan Prediction Analysis with Machine Learning
 I recently worked on a machine learning project focused on predicting loan approvals based on applicant data.
 ðŸ“Š Using classification models, I analyzed key features like credit history, income, and loan amount to improve decision-making.
 ðŸ“ˆ The goal was to reduce default risk and automate the loan approval process efficiently.
 ðŸ’¡ This project highlights how ML can bring smarter, faster decisions in the financial sector!
